 Positional Arguments
======================

Before opster
=============

Without using an argument parsing library such as opster, the simplest way to
construct a script that receives some command line arguments looks something
like::

    import sys

    print('hello')

.. literalinclude:: scripts/positional2.py
    :language: python

.. literalinclude:: scripts/positional1.py
